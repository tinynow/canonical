    <p>A color palette is a combination of completely subjective whims, rigid objective requirements, and general principles that are usually but not always good ides.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whims - I like green.</li>
        <li>Requirements - backgrounds must contrast with text, ui component, states of ui components, and graphical elements that convey meaning.</li>
        <li>General principles - a palette is generally dark with white or off-white text or light with black or dark-gray text.</li>
    </ul>
