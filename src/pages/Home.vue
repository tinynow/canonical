    <h1>A playground for serious play</h1>
    <p>I am a multi-disciplinary person who works full time for a large state agency. There, I do web development and design with a focus on accessibility, design systems, and content strategy. Here, I am free to sweat the small stuff and revel in the green fields.</p>
    <p>
        This site is a Vue powered application that I am developing out in the open. In addition to a portfolio site, it represents the development of a personal component libray and design system, a statically generated personal site and blog, "accessible by default" components, and tools like the <router-link to="/palette">
            You Can Use These Color Combinations tool
        </router-link>. More to come.
